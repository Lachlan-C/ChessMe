# ChessMe physical Board prototype

## Setup
To setup the board, download the Board folder within the Github Repository, and move it to a new directory.  
  
  Next, navigate to the board file in your command line, and run the following command to install dependencies:
  ```
  $ npm i
  ```
  Finally, to run the board, use the following command:  
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```
The command line will now act as a viewer for all messages going to and from the board. The messages are JSON objects, however they are converted to strings for communication purposes.  
The board itself can be accessed by accessing the following URL in your browser: `localhost:3001`
This system does need to be used in conjunction with the website, which can be found at: `INSERT WEBSITE URL HERE`
